This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Question 1: Figure out how to generically extract all numeric columns from any data frame so the method you develop can be used on any data.

require(ggplot2)
# Get the ggplot2 package which is an implementation of the grammer of graphics.
data(diamonds)
# Import the data diamonds from the global environment.
new_data <- diamonds[sapply(diamonds,is.numeric)]
# The function sapply(diamonds,is.numeric) I used here is to check the columns within the data frame diamonds and see if each column contains the numerical data. If so, all these data and their corresponding categories will be extracted. In this case, they are 'carat','depth','table','price','x','y' and 'z'. 

```

```{r}
# Question 2: Create a data frame that contains each pair of variable names in the first column in a single string seperated by a '-', and their corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient in the second column.

require(ggplot2)
# Get the ggplot2 package which is an implementation of the grammer of graphics.
data(diamonds)
# Import the data diamonds from the global environment.
string=''
# Initalize the first condition of string as ''. 
for (i in 1:6)
{string <- c(string,c(paste(colnames(new_data[i]),colnames(new_data[(i+1):7]),sep='-')))}
# Here I use a for loop to make each pair of variable names. There are total seven numeric variables; in order to avoid duplication, use the first variable to make pair with the remaining other six. Then the second one with the remaining five and so on. The paste function is used to concatenate these characters and use '-' to seperate thwm.
string <- c(string[-1])
# After that, remove the initial condition of string which is ''.
numeric=0
# Initalize the first variable named numeric into zero.
for (i in 1:6)
{numeric <-c(numeric,cor(new_data[i],new_data[(i+1):7],method='pearson'))}
# The same as before, use the second for loop to combine the numerical values of each responding variables. In this case, we do not make pair of values. Instead I use the cor() function to find the Pearson correlation coefficient for the values within the responding variables. Thus the return value should be a single number representing the correlation.
numeric <- c(numeric[-1])
# After that, remove the initial condition of the numeric which is zero.
name_correlation <-data.frame(string,numeric)
# The final step is to define a data frame named name_correlation to put all the previous data frames of string and numeric together. 

```

```{r}
# Question 3: Create label a scatter plot for every pair of numeric variables. Add a title to the plot that contains the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient of variables contained in the plot. 

require(ggplot2)
# Get the ggplot2 package which is an implementation of the grammer of graphics.
data(diamonds)
# Import the data diamonds from the global environment.
scatterplots <- par(mfrow=c(5,5))
# Use the par () function to combine all the plots into one overall graph. In this case, I create a 5*5 matrix to contain all the plots. One for each and name the overall graph scatterplots.
x=0
# Initilize the value of x to zero.
for (i in 1:6)
{
  for (j in (i+1):7)
{
  x=x+1
  plot(new_data[c(i,j)],main=c(name_correlation[x,2]))
}
}
# I use two for loops to create all the plots. First, extract all the necessary characters and their corresponding values from the data frame new_data. In order to avoid duplication, thus I use i and j. For instance: if i=1 stands for caret and its numerical values, then it can only pair with the other remaining six characters to create the plots which represented by j=2,3,4,5,6 and 7 and so on.When all the values have been paired, then add a title to each plot that contains the coefficient of relevant variables. Because all the coefficients are in the second column of the data frame name_correlation, so I use the index [] to find each of these values by assigning the specific row and column number. For instance: if x=10, then tenth plot will have a title which comes from the tenth row and second column of the data frame name_correlation which is about -0.0293.
par(scatterplots)
# Combine all the plots that come from the for loop into the overall graph named scatterplots.
scatterplots
# Display the graph scatterplots to the plots screen.
